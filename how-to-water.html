            <p>Each plant is unique and requires its own special care. We're here to help you to keep track of when your
                plants should be watered. If you're unsure of where to start, this guide will help you begin to tell
                exactly what your plants need.</p>

                        <h3>Watering Frequency</h3>
                        <p>Houseplants should be watered about every 3 - 5 days. The amount that you'll water your
                            houseplant depends on the size of the plant, but a good starting place for medium to small
                            sized plants is 1/3 to 1/2 of a cup.</p>

                        <p>An overwatered houseplant will still have very damp soil between waterings. You may notice
                            mold forming on the stem of the plant.</p>

                        <h3>How To Tell If Your Plant is Underwatered</h3>
                        <p>An underwatered house plant will have drooping leaves. If it is severely underwatered it may
                            start to yellow. If leaves on your underwatered houseplant begin to die, you can prune them
                            to allow the plant to focus its energy on the remaining healthy brush.</p>

            <h2>Watering Your Succulent</h2>
            <p>Succulents are desert plants. They are easy to overwater by accident.</p>

                        <h3>Watering Frequency</h3>
                        <p>Succulents evolved in an environment where it rains rarely. Similarly, you should only water
                            your succulent every 2 to 3 weeks, when you've noticed that the soil has completely dried
                            out.</p>

                        <p>An overwatered succulent will have plump, heavy leaves. Its soil will still be wet when you
                            think you are ready to water again.</p>

                        <p>If your succulent is underwatered, it will shriek in a tone so high-pitched that the human
                            ear cannot percieve it. If you suspect that your succulent is underwatered, simply place it
                            near a dog and watch the dog for signs of distress.</p>

            <h2>Watering Your Tropical Plant</h2>
            <p>Tropical plants are mysterious lifeforms used to wet, humid conditions. They require extra care to
                thrive.</p>

                        <h3>Watering Frequency</h3>
                        <p>Tropical plants divine their life essence from unique wells of chaos. You will know that it
                            is time to water your tropical plant because you will feel an creeping urge to do so, like a
                            friend whispering in your ear.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>How To Tell If Your Tropical Plant Is Overwatered</h3>
                        <p>In the event that a tropical plant approaches the status of being overwatered, it will enter
                            a state of distress. When in this state, the plant will teleport the excess moisture,
                            seemingly at random. Look for small puddles in your living space to indicate that you need
                            to slow down on the watering!</p>

                        <h3>How To Tell If Your Tropical Plant is Underwatered</h3>
                        <p>Similarly to an overwatered tropical plant, an underwatered tropical plant will enter a
                            distressed state. However, when underwatered, the plant will absorb water from unlikely
                            sources around its environment. To prevent any bodily fluids from being teleported to
                            support the plant's life-systems, we reccommend always leaving a glass of water near any
                            tropical plants that you have in your home.</p>
