            <div class="section-body blurb">
                <p>Plants do a lot for us. They can brighten up a room, bring life to an otherwise inhospitable space, or even clean the air that we breathe. There's a reason that plants are so popular in our homes, offices, and public spaces. But when you bring a plant indoors, you remove it from an environment where it would naturally be watered by the rain and given energy by the sun.</p>

                <p>In order to have vibrant, healthy plants in your own home, you have to keep up to date on their individual needs. All plants need water, and too much or too little water could do a lot of damage. Water My Plants takes the pain out of remembering the last time you watered your plants, or the next time that they need attention.</p>
